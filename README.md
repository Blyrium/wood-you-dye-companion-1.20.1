_All vanilla planks are supported except Warped and Crimson planks._

Tested with Fabric API 0.92.0+1.20.1 & Wood you Dye 1.1.0+1.20.1

This mod is provided "as is". It should technically work on all 1.20.X versions of the game. Support for _Wood you Dye_ versions above 1.1.0 isn't guaranteed. I am not planning to update/backport this mod to a different version of Minecraft. You're free to do so yourself, however.
